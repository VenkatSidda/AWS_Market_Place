=> service trusted access: ( only for Organization)
   i) Only available for AWS Organizations with ‘all-features’ enabled. 
                         AWS services for which you enable trusted access can access your 
                         organization information and perform actions in multiple AWS accounts 
                         within your organization.
                        ii) Specific to managed entitlements, this gives AWS LM and MP the ability to keep track of 
                          AWS Organizations activity on your behalf (e.g. knowing when accounts leave 
                           your organization, validating granted licenses to accounts within an organization


  service linked roles: (Both Account and Organization) (Manualle and automation)
       i) Only available for AWS Organizations with ‘all-features’ enabled. 
          AWS services for which you enable trusted access can access your organization 
          information and perform actions in multiple AWS accounts within your organization.
      ii) For managed entitlements, this permission is required so that AWS MP can successfully 
          orchestrate license workflows and distributions across multiple AWS services, 
          on the customer’s behalf. Similarly, 
          this permission is required for AWS LM to auto-accept grants between 
          management and member accounts in a ‘all features’ enabled organization.
